# 📈 Linear Regression - A Simple Guide  

Linear regression is one of the simplest ways to make predictions. It helps us find a relationship between two things (like how studying time affects exam scores) and draw a straight line that best fits the data.

## 🏗️ Basic Concepts  

### 🎯 **Bias**  
A constant added to the model to adjust predictions and make them more accurate.  

### 📉 **Linear Regression**  
A method that finds the best straight line to predict a value based on given data.  
Example: Predicting house prices based on size.  

### ⚙️ **Parameter**  
A value the model learns from data, like the slope of a line.  

### ⚖️ **Weight**  
A type of parameter that decides how much influence a feature has on predictions.

## 📏 Measuring Errors  

### 📊 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
The average of how far predictions are from actual values, treating all errors equally.  

### 🔢 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
The average of squared errors—gives more weight to large mistakes.  

### ⚖️ **L1 vs. L2 Regularization**  
- **L1 (Lasso Regression)**: Helps the model ignore unnecessary features.  
- **L2 (Ridge Regression)**: Reduces the effect of extreme values but keeps all features.  

### ❌ **Loss**  
The difference between what the model predicts and the actual value. Our goal is to make this as small as possible.  

### ⚠️ **Outlier**  
A data point that is very different from the rest and can affect predictions.

## 🚀 Training the Model  

### 🔄 **Convergence**  
When the model has learned enough and stops improving.  

### 📈 **Convex Function**  
A function that has a single lowest point (minimum), making it easier for the model to find the best solution.  

### 📉 **Gradient Descent**  
A method to find the best parameters by gradually adjusting them to minimize the loss.  

### 🔄 **Iteration**  
One cycle where the model updates its parameters to improve predictions.  

### 📊 **Loss Curve**  
A graph that shows how the loss decreases over time as the model learns.

## ⚙️ Fine-Tuning the Model  

### 🎛️ **Batch Size**  
The number of data points used in each training step.  

### 🔁 **Epoch**  
One complete pass through the entire dataset during training.  

### 🌍 **Generalization**  
A good model should work well on new, unseen data, not just the training data.  

### 🔧 **Hyperparameter**  
Settings that are chosen before training, like learning rate and batch size, to control how the model learns.  

### ⚡ **Learning Rate**  
A value that controls how big or small the steps are when updating parameters. A high learning rate can learn fast but may overshoot the best solution, while a low rate learns slowly but steadily.

## 📦 Types of Gradient Descent  

### 🎯 **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**  
Uses small groups of data instead of the whole dataset for faster training.  

### 🎲 **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**  
Updates the model using one data point at a time—faster but noisier.  

### ⚖️ **Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent**  
A mix of batch and stochastic gradient descent—balances speed and accuracy.

## 🤖 Advanced Concept  

### 🧠 **Neural Network**  
A more complex model inspired by the human brain that can learn patterns in data, often using multiple layers of linear regression.
